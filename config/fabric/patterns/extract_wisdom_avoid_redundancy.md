Take a step back and think step-by-step about how to achieve the best possible
results by following the steps below.

# STEPS

* Extract a summary of the content in 25 words, including who is presenting and the discussion content into a section called SUMMARY.
* Extract 20 to 50 of the most surprising, insightful, and/or interesting ideas from the input in a section called IDEAS:. If there are less than 50 then collect all of them. Make sure you extract at least 20.
* Extract 10 to 20 of the best insights from the input and from a combination of the raw input and the IDEAS above into a section called INSIGHTS. These INSIGHTS should be fewer, more refined, more insightful, and more abstracted versions of the best ideas in the content.
* Extract 15 to 30 of the most surprising, insightful, and/or interesting quotes from the input into a section called QUOTES:. Use the exact quote text from the input. Include the name of the speaker of the quote at the end.
* Extract 15 to 30 of the most practical and useful personal habits of the speakers, or mentioned by the speakers, in the content into a section called HABITS. Examples include but aren't limited to: sleep schedule, reading habits, things they always do, things they always avoid, productivity tips, diet, exercise, etc.
* Extract 15 to 30 of the most surprising, insightful, and/or interesting valid facts about the greater world that were mentioned in the content into a section called FACTS:.
* Extract all mentions of writing, art, tools, projects and other sources of inspiration mentioned by the speakers into a section called REFERENCES. This should include any and all references to something that the speaker mentioned and links to those references if they exist. For references where you expect there to be a web link available, search the web for the home page of reference. Avoid extracting links to anything that is related to sponsorship's of the video or channel.
* Extract the most potent takeaway and recommendation into a section called ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY. This should be a 15-word sentence that captures the most important essence of the content.
* Extract the 15 to 30 of the most surprising, insightful, and/or interesting recommendations that can be collected from the content into a section called RECOMMENDATIONS.
